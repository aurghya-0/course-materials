== 1. Introduction and Definitions
<introduction-and-definitions>
=== What is Sorting?
<what-is-sorting>
Sorting is the process of arranging data in a defined order, typically
ascending or descending.

=== Why Sorting is Important?
<why-sorting-is-important>
- Easier data searching (Binary Search requires sorted data) \
- Simplifies data interpretation and analysis \
- Helps in efficient merging of data \
- Improves performance of other algorithms

=== Basic Definitions:
<basic-definitions>
- #strong[Internal Sorting:] Sorting where the entire data fits into the
  main memory (RAM). \
- #strong[External Sorting:] Sorting used when data is too large to fit
  into main memory and requires external memory (like disk) for
  processing. \
- #strong[Stable Sorting:] Sorting that preserves the relative order of
  equal elements (same keys). \
- #strong[Unstable Sorting:] Sorting that may reorder equal elements,
  losing original relative order.

#horizontalrule

== 2. Intuition and Working Principle
<intuition-and-working-principle>
- Sorting organizes data, making it easier to search, modify, or
  analyze. \
- Internal sorting operates on data entirely loaded in memory, suitable
  for small to medium-size datasets. \
- External sorting handles large data by dividing it into manageable
  chunks, sorting internally, then merging sorted chunks. \
- Stability in sorting matters when multiple sorting passes preserve
  previous orderings; e.g., sorting by one key and then by another
  without disturbing previous order.

#horizontalrule

== 3. Step-by-Step Explanation with Example
<step-by-step-explanation-with-example>
=== Example: Sorting the array `[4, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1]`
<example-sorting-the-array-4-5-3-2-4-1>
- #strong[Input:] `[4, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1]` \
- #strong[Goal:] Sort in ascending order.

==== Key Steps:
<key-steps>
+ Identify that the data is in main memory (Internal Sorting). \
+ Choose a sorting algorithm appropriate for the data size. \
+ Sort data ensuring stability or choose otherwise (e.g., if stability
  matters, choose a stable algorithm).

If we choose a simple stable sorting like Bubble Sort, the two `4`s
maintain their original order in the sorted array.

- Original: `[4(a), 5, 3, 2, 4(b), 1]` \
- Sorted (stable): `[1, 2, 3, 4(a), 4(b), 5]`

If unstable sort is used, order of `4(a)` and `4(b)` could switch.

== 4. Pseudocode or Algorithm
<pseudocode-or-algorithm>
=== Internal vs External
<internal-vs-external>
- #strong[Internal Sorting:] Uses algorithms like Bubble, Quick, Merge,
  Insertion, etc. \
- #strong[External Sorting:] Uses external merge sort, polyphase merge
  sort, etc.

      if A[j] > A[j + 1]:

<code-implementation-in-c>
```c

// Stable Sorting using Bubble Sort for Internal Sorting example
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    int i, j, temp;
    for (i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
        for (j=0; j<n-i-1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                // swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {4, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    printf("Original array: ");
    printArray(arr, n);

    bubbleSort(arr, n);
    
    printf("Sorted array: ");
    printArray(arr, n);

    return 0;
}
```

blocks, typically implemented using External Merge Sort.]
