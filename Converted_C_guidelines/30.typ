= Definition of Functions and Recursion in C
<teaching-guideline-definition-of-functions-and-recursion-in-c>

== 1. Teaching Outline
<teaching-outline>
=== Introduction
<introduction>
- Briefly introduce the concept of modular programming.
- Importance of functions in organizing code, improving readability, and
  reusability.

=== Key Definitions
<key-definitions>
- #strong[Function];: A block of code that performs a specific task, is
  reusable, and can be called multiple times.
- #strong[Function Definition];: The code that specifies what the
  function does.
- #strong[Function Declaration (Prototype)];: Tells the compiler about
  the function name, return type, and parameters before it's used.
- #strong[Function Call];: The act of invoking a function to execute the
  code inside it.
- #strong[Recursion];: A programming technique in which a function calls
  itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.
- #strong[Base Case and Recursive Case];: Core to writing correct
  recursive functions.

=== Important Syntax and Rules in C
<important-syntax-and-rules-in-c>
- #strong[Function Definition Syntax:]

  ```c
  return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
      // function body
  }
  ```

- #strong[Function Call Syntax:]

  ```c
  variable = function_name(arguments);
  ```

- Proper use of return types (`void` for no return).

- Importance of matching function declarations with definitions.

- Scope of variables in functions (local vs global).

- Recursive function requirements:

  - Base case that stops recursion.
  - Recursive call moving towards the base case.

=== Examples and Demonstrations
<examples-and-demonstrations>
- Simple function example: A function to add two integers.
- Using functions with parameters and return values.
- Recursive function example: Factorial of a number.
- Another recursive example: Fibonacci sequence.
- Stepwise execution walkthrough & call stack visualization for
  recursion.

=== Common Mistakes to Avoid
<common-mistakes-to-avoid>
- Forgetting to return a value when the return type is non-void.
- Incorrect or missing function declarations leading to compilation
  errors.
- Infinite recursion due to missing or incorrect base case.
- Passing wrong arguments or mismatching parameter types.
- Misunderstanding parameter scope and unintended side effects.
- Overusing recursion when iteration is simpler.

=== Real-World Applications
<real-world-applications>
- Using functions to modularize large programs (e.g., sorting
  algorithms, input validation).
- Recursive techniques used in:
  - File system traversal
  - Algorithmic problems like tree traversals, divide and conquer (e.g.,
    quicksort, mergesort)
  - Solving mathematical problems (e.g., combinatorial problems)
- Emphasize the role of recursion in simplifying complex problems.

#strong[Problem:] Given the recursive function below, trace and write
down the order of function calls for `func(3)`.

```c

= Additional Tips for Teaching
<additional-tips-for-teaching>
- Use live coding and immediate feedback tools.
- Visual aids for recursion --- diagrams or stack simulations.
- Encourage students to test boundary conditions (0, negative inputs).
- Promote writing comments to clarify function purpose.
- Regularly recap and link new concepts to previous knowledge.
