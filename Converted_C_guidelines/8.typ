<teaching-guideline-find-square-root-of-a-quadratic-equation-c-programming>

== 1. Teaching Outline
<teaching-outline>
=== A. Introduction to Quadratic Equations
<a.-introduction-to-quadratic-equations>
- #strong[Key definitions:]
  - Quadratic equation format: ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 )
  - Coefficients: ( a, b, c )
  - Roots/solutions: solutions (x) satisfying equation
  - Discriminant (D = b^2 - 4ac)
- #strong[Importance of discriminant:]
  - (D \> 0): Two distinct real roots
  - (D = 0): One real root (repeated)
  - (D \< 0): Complex roots (non-real)

=== B. Square Root and Discriminant in Solving Quadratics
<b.-square-root-and-discriminant-in-solving-quadratics>
- Using the quadratic formula: \[ x = \]
- Role of the square root function (`sqrt`) for discriminant calculation
- Handling different cases based on discriminant

=== C. Important C Syntax & Rules
<c.-important-c-syntax-rules>
- Including math library: `#include <math.h>`
- Using `sqrt(double)` function from math library
- Data types: `double` or `float` for roots (precision)
- Validating input to avoid division by zero (e.g., (a ))
- Conditional statements for discriminant checks
- Printing formatted output with `printf` and format specifiers
  (e.g.~`%lf` for double)
- Linking math library during compilation (`-lm` flag)

=== D. Step-by-Step Example Demonstration
<d.-step-by-step-example-demonstration>
- Show example: (2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0)
- Calculate discriminant in C
- Calculate roots using sqrt
- Print roots
- Show behavior for different discriminant values

=== E. Common Mistakes to Avoid
<e.-common-mistakes-to-avoid>
- Forgetting `#include <math.h>`
- Not adding `-lm` flag during compilation
  (`gcc program.c -o program -lm`)
- Using `int` instead of `double` for roots (less precise)
- Not checking if (a=0) (then not a quadratic equation)
- Trying to sqrt a negative discriminant without handling complex roots
- Poor input validation
- Printing without formatting specifiers or wrong specifiers

=== F. Real-world Applications
<f.-real-world-applications>
- Physics (projectile motion: time to hit ground)
- Engineering (circuit analysis, mechanical systems)
- Computer graphics (parabolas for trajectories)
- Financial modeling (polynomial fitting, curve approximation)
