    \
    \[ x = x - + - + \] \

==== C. Detailed Conceptual Breakdown
<c.-detailed-conceptual-breakdown>
- #strong[Computing Sine Series:]
  - Using a `for` loop to calculate terms \
  - Calculating factorial (iteratively) inside or outside loop \
  - Alternating sign logic using `pow(-1, i)` or a toggling variable \
  - Using double to store results for precision \

- #strong[Checking Palindrome Number:]
  - Reverse the given integer mathematically (modulus and division) \
  - Compare reversed number with original \
  - Input validation (non-negative integers)

  division) \
- Incorrect factorial calculation (off-by-one errors) \
- Overflow risk in factorial and power functions -- choosing appropriate
  data types \
- Confusing the sign alternation in sine series \
- Misinterpreting palindrome for negative numbers (define behavior
  clearly) \

  check)

  graphics, signal processing where sine values are approximated in
  software/hardware. \
