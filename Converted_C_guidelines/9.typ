C programming bootcamp.



= Teaching Guideline: Multiplication of Two Matrices in C
<teaching-guideline-multiplication-of-two-matrices-in-c>



== 1. Teaching Outline
<teaching-outline>
=== Introduction
<introduction>
- #strong[What is a matrix?]
  - Define matrix as a 2D array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
- #strong[Matrix multiplication definition]
  - Explain that matrix multiplication involves multiplying rows of the
    first matrix by columns of the second matrix.
  - Mention the condition for multiplication: If matrix A is of size
    `m x n`, and matrix B is of size `p x q`, then multiplication AB is
    possible only if `n == p`. Resulting matrix size is `m x q`.

=== Key Definitions
<key-definitions>
- Matrix
- Matrix dimensions (rows and columns)
- Matrix multiplication rules and condition
- Resultant matrix

=== Important Syntax and Rules in C
<important-syntax-and-rules-in-c>
- Declaring 2D arrays (`int matrix[rows][columns];`)
- Nested loops for traversing matrices
- Accessing elements of 2D arrays (`matrix[i][j]`)
- Using loops: `for` loops to iterate over rows and columns
- Initializing matrices (hard-coded vs user input)
- Summation and multiplication inside loops
  (`result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];`)

=== Step-by-step Matrix Multiplication Logic
<step-by-step-matrix-multiplication-logic>
- Outer loop for rows of first matrix (i)
- Middle loop for columns of second matrix (j)
- Inner loop for sum-product calculation for each element (k)

=== Examples and Demonstrations
<examples-and-demonstrations>
- Start with multiplying 2x2 matrices with predefined values
- Live coding the matrix multiplication function
- Show dynamic size matrices with user input for dimensions and values
- Print matrices before and after multiplication for clarity

=== Common Mistakes to Avoid
<common-mistakes-to-avoid>
- Ignoring dimension compatibility (not checking n == p)
- Incorrect use of indices inside nested loops
- Overwriting results or forgetting to initialize result matrix elements
  to zero before summation
- Confusing row and column lengths in loops
- Not handling dimension input validation by user
- Using non-initialized variables

=== Real-world Applications
<real-world-applications>

- Computer vision and image processing
- Scientific computations and engineering simulations
- Data transformations in machine learning preprocessing
