# PCC-CS301 : Data Structures and Algorithms with C  
## Unit 1: Introduction to Time-Space Trade-off  
### Topic: Relationship and Trade-offs Between Time and Space

---

## 1. Introduction and Definitions

- **Time Complexity:** The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.
- **Space Complexity:** The amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution.
- **Time-Space Trade-off:** A principle in algorithm design where saving time may require using more space, or reducing space usage may increase computation time.

**Why is this important?**  
Optimizing programs for performance involves balancing how much memory is used against how fast the program runs.

## 2. Intuition and Working Principle

- Imagine you want to speed up data retrieval.
- One way: Precompute results and store them (use more space, less time).
- Another way: Calculate the results every time (use less space, more time).
- Trade-offs depend on application context: available resources, performance goals, memory constraints.

**Simple analogy:**  
Using a **dictionary** (space-heavy) to look up meanings instantly (fast) vs. trying to guess the meaning every time (slow but no dictionary needed).

## 3. Step-by-step Explanation with Example

**Problem:** Calculating Fibonacci numbers.

- **Naive Recursive Approach:**  
  Calculate `fib(n)` by recursively summing `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`.  
  - Time: Exponential (lots of repeated calculations).  
  - Space: Low (call stack only).

- **Dynamic Programming / Memoization:**  
  Store previously calculated values in an array (memo) to avoid recomputation.  
  - Time: Linear.  
  - Space: Additional memory used for storage.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Start with base cases (`fib(0) = 0`, `fib(1) = 1`).
2. For computing `fib(n)`, check if result is already stored.
3. If yes, return the stored result (fast).
4. If no, calculate recursively and store it (space cost).

## 4. Pseudocode or Algorithm

```
function fib(n, memo):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if memo[n] is not empty:
        return memo[n]
    
    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

## 5. Code Implementation in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Fibonacci with memoization (time-space trade-off)
int fib(int n, int *memo) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    
    if (memo[n] != -1) {  // Previously computed
        return memo[n];
    }
    
    memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example input
    int *memo = (int *)malloc((n + 1) * sizeof(int));
    
    // Initialize memo array with -1 to indicate uncomputed states
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        memo[i] = -1;
    }
    
    printf("Fibonacci number at position %d is %d\n", n, fib(n, memo));
    
    free(memo);
    return 0;
}
```

## 6. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

| Approach               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity                |
|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Naive Recursive        | O(2^n)          | O(n) (call stack)              |
| Memoized (DP)          | O(n)            | O(n) (memo array + call stack) |

- **Trade-off:** Memoization uses extra space (`O(n)`) to drastically reduce time from exponential to linear.
- You can further optimize space by storing only recent Fibonacci values (reduce space at cost of code complexity).

---

## 7. Real-world Applications

- **Caching results:** Web browsers, databases cache responses to reduce load time.
- **Compression algorithms:** Store precomputed data for quick decompression.
- **Graphics rendering:** Use of lookup tables for quick color or pixel computations.
- **Cryptography:** Precomputed tables to speed up encryption/decryption at cost of memory.
- **Embedded systems:** Where memory is limited, sometimes algorithms are slowed to save space.

## 8. Key Takeaways

- Time-space trade-offs are fundamental in algorithm design.
- Using more memory can often reduce runtime and vice versa.
- Choose trade-offs based on constraints: resource availability, required speed, and memory limits.
- Techniques like memoization and caching exemplify time-space trade-off.
- Always analyze both time and space complexity before deciding on an approach.

## 9. Practice Questions or Problems

1. Implement a factorial function using memoization to improve computation time. Analyze its time and space trade-offs.
2. Compare iterative and recursive binary search in terms of time and space complexity.
3. Solve the subset sum problem using dynamic programming. Discuss the memory usage and time trade-offs involved.
4. Design a program to calculate the power of a number (`x^n`) with and without memoization; compare the complexities.
5. Explain a real-world scenario from your experience where you had to make a time-space trade-off when coding.
