# Teaching Guideline: GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and Primality Testing in C

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### A. Introduction to GCD and Prime Numbers
- **Definition of GCD:** 
  - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
- **Definition of Prime Number:** 
  - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### B. Key Concepts and Algorithms
- **Why GCD is Important:** 
  - Simplifying fractions, cryptography, algorithms.
- **Methods to Find GCD:**
  1. **Naive Approach:** Check every integer from min(a, b) down to 1.
  2. **Euclidean Algorithm:** Uses division and remainder, more efficient.

- **Testing if a Number is Prime:**
  - Check divisibility from 2 to sqrt(n).
  - If divisible by any number in the range, not prime.
  - Special cases: numbers ≤ 1 are not prime.

### C. Important C Syntax & Rules
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Function definition and return statements
- Modulo operator `%` for remainder
- Input/output basics (`scanf`, `printf`)

### D. Example and Demonstrations
- Implement Euclidean algorithm for GCD.
- Implement prime number test function.
- Show sample outputs for multiple test cases.

### E. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting to handle edge cases (e.g., numbers ≤ 1 for prime check).
- Using incorrect loop boundaries causing infinite loops or off-by-one errors.
- Not using the modulo operator correctly.
- Not returning the correct value from the function.
- Inefficient algorithms causing slow execution on large inputs.

### F. Real-World Applications
- Cryptography (e.g., RSA algorithm uses prime numbers).
- Simplifying fractions in calculators and software.
- Network and computer science algorithms.
- Error detection and correction methods.

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

### Q1: Write a function to calculate the GCD of two positive integers using the naive approach.
- **Concept:** Basic loop and conditional statements, modulo operator.
- **Hint:** Loop from min(a,b) down to 1 and check divisibility.

### Q2: Implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two integers.
- **Concept:** Efficient GCD calculation using recursion or iteration.
- **Hint:** Use the formula `GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)` until b is 0.

### Q3: Write a function to test if a given number is prime using the simplest method (check divisibility by all numbers from 2 to n-1).
- **Concept:** Loops, conditionals, logic for prime testing.
- **Hint:** Return false as soon as you find a divisor.

### Q4: Optimize the prime test function by checking up to `sqrt(n)` instead of `n-1`.
- **Concept:** Algorithm optimization, understanding limits of loops.
- **Hint:** Use `sqrt` function from `<math.h>` or estimate integer square root.

### Q5: Combine both concepts: Write a main program that reads two numbers, prints their GCD, and states whether each number is prime.
- **Concept:** Function calls, integration of multiple small programs.
- **Hint:** Reuse your earlier functions.
