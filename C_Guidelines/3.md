# Teaching Guideline: Programming Style — Names, Documentation & Format, Refinement & Modularity

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### A. Introduction to Programming Style
- **Definition:** The conventions and best practices developers follow to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- **Importance:** Improves collaboration, debugging, and code longevity.

---

### B. Naming Conventions
- **Key Definitions:**
  - **Identifier:** Name given to variables, functions, constants, etc.
- **Important Rules & Conventions:**
  - Use meaningful, descriptive names.
  - Consistent casing style:
    - `camelCase` (e.g., `totalSum`)
    - `snake_case` (e.g., `total_sum`)
    - `PascalCase` for types, structs.
  - Avoid single-letter variables except in loops (`i`, `j`).
  - Use nouns for variables and functions that return a value.
  - Use verbs for function names (e.g., `calculateSum()`).
  - Constants in uppercase `MAX_SIZE`.
- **Examples:**
  ```c
  int studentAge;
  float calculateArea(float radius);
  #define MAX_STUDENTS 30
  ```
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Using unclear names like `x`, `data`, or `temp`.
  - Inconsistent naming styles in the same program.
- **Real-world Application:**
  - Large projects with multi-person teams.

---

### C. Documentation
- **Key Definitions:**
  - Inline comments, block comments, and documentation comments.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Comment why, not what (avoid obvious comments).
  - Use clear, concise language.
  - Document function purpose, parameters, return values.
  - Document complex logic and assumptions.
- **Syntax:**
  - Single line comments: `// comment`
  - Multi-line comments: `/* comment */`
- **Examples:**
  ```c
  // Calculate the area of a circle given the radius
  float calculateArea(float radius) {
      return 3.14 * radius * radius;
  }
  ```
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Over-commenting trivial code.
  - Outdated comments that no longer reflect code.
- **Real-world Application:**
  - Code maintenance and API documentation.

---

### D. Formatting and Code Layout
- **Key Rules:**
  - Consistent indentation (usually 2 or 4 spaces).
  - Proper use of braces `{}`.
  - Line length limits (80-100 characters).
  - Blank lines to separate logical blocks.
  - Align related code vertically when helpful.
- **Examples:**
  ```c
  if (condition) {
      // indented block
      doSomething();
  } else {
      doOtherThing();
  }
  ```
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Mixing tabs and spaces.
  - Missing braces leading to bugs.
  - Inconsistent indentation.
- **Real-world Application:**
  - Readable code in open source and professional projects.

---

### E. Refinement and Clean Code Principles
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Refactor to remove duplication.
  - Keep functions short and focused.
  - Use meaningful variable scope (local vs global).
  - Avoid magic numbers — use named constants.
- **Examples:**
  ```c
  #define PI 3.14159

  float areaCircle(float radius) {
      return PI * radius * radius;
  }
  ```
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Long functions doing too many things.
  - Hardcoding values repeatedly.
- **Real-world Application:**
  - Code evolution and bug reduction.

---

### F. Modularity and Separation of Concerns
- **Key Definitions:**
  - Breaking program into independent modules/functions.
- **Importance:**
  - Easier testing and maintenance.
  - Code reuse.
- **Techniques:**
  - Use functions to encapsulate logic.
  - Create header files for declarations.
  - Separate implementation (`.c`) and interface (`.h`).
- **Examples:**
  ```c
  // math_utils.h
  float calculateArea(float radius);

  // math_utils.c
  #include "math_utils.h"
  float calculateArea(float radius) {
      return 3.14 * radius * radius;
  }
  ```
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Monolithic main functions.
  - Global variables overuse.
- **Real-world Application:**
  - Large software systems, APIs, libraries.

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

---

### Question 1: Naming Practice (Basic)
- **Problem:** Rename the variable `a` to a more meaningful name in this code snippet:
  ```c
  int a = 10;
  int b = 20;
  int c = a + b;
  ```
- **Concept Tested:** Naming conventions for variables.
- **Hint:** Think about what the variables represent.

---

### Question 2: Writing Comments (Basic)
- **Problem:** Add a comment explaining the purpose of this function:
  ```c
  int square(int x) {
      return x * x;
  }
  ```
- **Concept Tested:** Effective and meaningful documentation.
- **Hint:** Describe what the function does, not how.

---

### Question 3: Correct Indentation and Braces (Intermediate)
- **Problem:** Fix the formatting of this code snippet:
  ```c
  if(x>0){
  printf("Positive");
  }else
  {
  printf("Non-positive");
  }
  ```
- **Concept Tested:** Formatting and code readability.

---

### Question 4: Refactoring into Functions (Intermediate)
- **Problem:** Refactor this repeated code so it’s modular:
  ```c
  printf("Area of circle: %f\n", 3.14 * r1 * r1);
  printf("Area of circle: %f\n", 3.14 * r2 * r2);
  ```
- **Concept Tested:** Modularity and avoiding code duplication.
- **Hint:** Create a function to calculate the area.

---

### Question 5: Modularizing Code with Header and Source Files (Advanced)
- **Problem:** Given a main program that calculates areas, outline how you would organize it with header and source files.
- **Concept Tested:** Separation of concerns, modularity in project structure.
- **Hint:** Identify the functions, create `.h` for declarations and `.c` for implementations.

---

## 3. Homework Practice Questions

---

### Homework 1: Naming and Documentation (Basic)
- **Problem:** Write a simple C program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Use clear variable names and add comments explaining the code.
- **Concept Tested:** Naming conventions and documentation.

---

### Homework 2: Formatting Code (Intermediate)
- **Problem:** Given poorly formatted code, rewrite it with proper indentation, spacing, and braces:
  ```c
  for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
  printf("%d\n",i);}
  ```
- **Concept Tested:** Code format and readability.

---

### Homework 3: Refinement (Intermediate)
- **Problem:** Refactor this code to eliminate magic numbers and improve readability:
  ```c
  int circumference = 2 * 3.14 * radius;
  ```
- **Concept Tested:** Use of named constants (#define or const).

---

### Homework 4: Creating Modular Functions (Advanced)
- **Problem:** Write a C program split into two files (`math_ops.c` and `math_ops.h`) that provide functions to compute the area of a circle and the circumference. Include proper documentation and modularize your code.
- **Concept Tested:** Modularity, header/source files, documentation.

---

### Homework 5: Code Review and Improvement (Advanced)
- **Problem:** Review the following code snippet. Identify at least three style problems and suggest improvements:
  ```c
  int x=0;
  void foo(){
  for(x=0;x<10;x++){
  printf("%d",x);}
  }
  ```
- **Concept Tested:** Style critique, naming, scope, formatting.

---

# Additional Tips for The Teacher:
- Encourage live coding demonstrations.
- Highlight the difference a good style can make by showing poorly styled vs well-styled code.
- Use pair programming or group discussion for in-class exercises.
- Provide quick quizzes or flash cards for naming conventions and formatting.
- Use real open-source projects to exemplify modularity and documentation standards.
