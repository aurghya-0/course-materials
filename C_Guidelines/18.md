# Teaching Guideline: Conditions and Relational Operators in C

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### A. Introduction to Conditions and Relational Operators
- **Key Definitions:**
  - **Condition:** An expression evaluated to either true or false.
  - **Relational Operators:** Operators used to compare two values.
  
- **Why Conditions Matter:**
  - Control flow decisions (if, if-else, switch)
  - Making programs dynamic based on inputs or states.

---

### B. Key Relational Operators in C
| Operator | Meaning               | Example       | Result        |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `==`     | Equal to              | `a == b`      | true if equal |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `a != b`      | true if not equal |
| `<`      | Less than             | `a < b`       | true if a is less than b |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `a > b`       | true if a is greater than b |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to | `a <= b`      | true if a is less or equal to b |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `a >= b`    | true if a is greater or equal to b |

---

### C. Syntax and Rules for Using Conditions
- Conditions must return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- In C, **true** is any non-zero value; **false** is `0`.
- Use conditions inside control statements:
  
```c
if (condition) {
    // code runs if condition is true
}
```
  
- Importance of using `==` for comparison (not `=` which is assignment)
- Block scope `{}` for multiple statements under a condition.

---

### D. Examples and Demonstrations
1. **Simple if statement:**

```c
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    printf("x is greater than 5\n");
}
```

2. **If-else statement:**

```c
int y = 3;
if (y == 3) {
    printf("y equals 3\n");
} else {
    printf("y is not 3\n");
}
```

3. **Chained if-else (if-else if-else):**

```c
int score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
    printf("Grade A\n");
} else if (score >= 75) {
    printf("Grade B\n");
} else {
    printf("Grade C or below\n");
}
```

4. **Using relational operators in conditions**

---

### E. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using assignment `=` instead of equality `==` inside conditions (e.g. `if (x = 5)` instead of `if (x == 5)`).
- Forgetting braces `{}` especially when multiple statements follow a condition.
- Confusing logical operators (`&&`, `||`) with relational operators.
- Not understanding that relational expressions return `1` (true) or `0` (false).
- Misreading the `!=` operator.

---

### F. Real-World Applications
- Input validation (e.g., checking if user input falls within a valid range).
- Decision making in programs (for example, access control: `if (age >= 18)`).
- Loop exit conditions.
- Simple game logic (win/lose conditions).

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

---

### Question 1: Basic Relational Operator
**Problem:** Write an `if` statement that checks if a number stored in variable `num` is less than 100 and prints `"Less than 100"` if true.  
**Concept:** Using `<` operator in `if` condition.  
**Hint:** Use `if (num < 100)`.

---

### Question 2: Equality Check
**Problem:** Given an integer `age`, write an `if-else` statement that prints `"Adult"` if age is exactly 18, and `"Not 18"` otherwise.  
**Concept:** Checking equality with `==` and using `else`.  
**Hint:** Careful with `==` vs `=`.

---

### Question 3: Multiple Conditions with if-else if
**Problem:** Given a variable `score`, print:
- `"Pass"` if score is 50 or more,
- `"Fail"` if less than 50.  
Modify the program to print `"Excellent"` if score is 90 or above.  
**Concept:** Multiple relational checks using if-else if.  
**Hint:** Order matters; check higher score first.

---

### Question 4: Detecting Incorrect Assignment in Condition
**Problem:** Explain why the code below may not work as expected and how to fix it:
```c
int x = 10;
if (x = 20) {
    printf("x is 20\n");
}
```
**Concept:** Difference between assignment `=` and equality `==` in conditions.  
**Hint:** What does `x = 20` do inside `if`?

---

### Question 5: Combining Conditions (Discuss Relational vs Logical)
**Problem:** Write a program that prints `"In range"` if a number `n` is greater than 10 and less than 20, otherwise `"Out of range"`.  
**Concept:** Combining relational expressions with logical `&&`.  
**Hint:** Syntax: `if (n > 10 && n < 20)`.

---

## 3. Homework Practice Questions

---

### HW Question 1: Simple Comparison
**Problem:** Write a program to input two integers and print which one is larger, or if they are equal.  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Concept:** Using `if`, `else if`, and relational operators `>`, `<`, `==`.

---

### HW Question 2: Age Group Classification
**Problem:** Write a program that reads integer input `age` and classifies:
- Child: 0–12 years,
- Teenager: 13–19 years,
- Adult: 20 and above,
- Invalid: negative ages.  
Print the respective category.  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Concept:** Multiple conditions and edge cases.

---

### HW Question 3: Leap Year Checker
**Problem:** Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.
- A year is leap if divisible by 400, or divisible by 4 but not 100.  
Print `"Leap Year"` or `"Not a Leap Year"`.  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Concept:** Combining relational operators and modulo `%` with logical `&&` and `||`.

---

### HW Question 4: Understanding Condition Results
**Problem:** What will the following code print? Explain why.
```c
int a = 5, b = 10;
if (a > b) {
    printf("A is greater\n");
} else {
    printf("A is not greater\n");
}
printf("%d\n", a > b);
```
**Difficulty:** Conceptual  
**Concept:** Boolean result of relational expressions in C.

---

### HW Question 5: Find the Mistake
**Problem:** Review the following code snippet. If there is any mistake in the condition, identify and correct it.
```c
int x = 7;
if (x = 7) {
    printf("x is seven\n");
}
```
**Difficulty:** Easy/Conceptual  
**Concept:** Understanding assignment vs equality.

- Encourage students to predict output before running.
- Highlight error messages generated from common mistakes.
- Provide instant feedback on in-class exercises.
- Periodically recap to reinforce logic flow involving conditions.
