# Teaching Guideline: Decision Making within a Program (C Language)

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### Introduction to Decision Making

- **Key Definition**:  
  Decision making in programming refers to the ability to choose different paths of execution based on certain conditions. This allows programs to respond dynamically to input or data.

### Subtopics & Concepts

#### a. Conditional Statements Overview
- **if statement**  
  - Syntax and usage  
  - Single statement vs. block statement  
- **if-else statement**  
  - Structure and flow  
  - Nesting if-else  
- **else if ladder**  
  - Handling multiple conditions sequentially  
- **switch-case statement**  
  - When to use switch  
  - Syntax rules and break statement importance  
  - Default case

#### b. Boolean Expressions and Logical Operators
- **Relational operators**: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`  
- **Logical operators**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)  
- Truth tables and evaluation order  
- Combining conditions  

#### c. Syntax and Rules
- Proper use of parentheses `()` in conditions  
- Curly braces `{}` for blocks of code  
- Semicolon placement and common syntax errors  
- Importance of break in switch statements  
- Scope of variables inside decision blocks  

#### d. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using assignment `=` instead of equality `==` in if conditions  
- Missing braces leading to ambiguous code execution  
- Forgetting break in switch cases causing fall-through bugs  
- Over-nesting leading to hard-to-read code  
- Mixing logical operator precedence without parentheses

#### e. Real-World Applications
- Input validation (e.g., checking user input validity)  
- Menu-driven programs using switch-case  
- Grading systems using if-else if ladder  
- Device control decisions (e.g., turning devices ON/OFF based on sensor input)  
- Error handling and exception conditions

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

### Question 1: Basic if statement  
**Problem:** Write a program snippet that checks if a number is positive and prints `"Positive number"` if true.  
**Concept:** Simple if condition  
**Hint:** Use `if (number > 0)`

---

### Question 2: if-else for even/odd check  
**Problem:** Write code to check if a number is even or odd and print the result accordingly.  
**Concept:** if-else condition  
**Hint:** Use modulus operator `%`

---

### Question 3: else-if ladder for grade evaluation  
**Problem:** Given an integer grade (0-100), write an if-else if ladder to print the letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).  
**Concept:** Multiple conditional decisions  
**Hint:** Check ranges using inequalities (e.g., `grade >= 90`)

---

### Question 4: Switch-case for menu options  
**Problem:** Implement a switch-case statement to print the name of a day based on a number (1 for Sunday, ..., 7 for Saturday).  
**Concept:** switch-case statements  
**Hint:** Remember to add `break` after each case

---

### Question 5: Logical operators in combined conditions  
**Problem:** Write a condition to check if a number is in the range 50 to 100 (inclusive), and also divisible by 5. Print `"Valid"` if true.  
**Concept:** Combining relational and logical operators (`&&`)  
**Hint:** Use `(number >= 50 && number <= 100 && number % 5 == 0)`

---

## 3. Homework Practice Questions

### Homework 1: Negative or zero check (Basic)  
**Problem:** Write a program that reads an integer and prints `"Negative"`, `"Zero"`, or `"Positive"` using if-else if ladder.

---

### Homework 2: Leap year checker (Intermediate)  
**Problem:** Write code to determine if a year entered by the user is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except if it is divisible by 400.  
**Key Concept:** Nested if and logical operators

---

### Homework 3: Switch-case fall-through (Conceptual)  
**Problem:** Explain what happens if `break` statements are omitted in a switch-case. Use a small example in your explanation.  
**Key Concept:** Understanding flow control and fall-through behavior

---

### Homework 4: Calculator program (Advanced)  
**Problem:** Create a simple calculator using switch-case that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers based on user input for the operation (+, -, *, /). Handle division by zero with an appropriate message.  
**Key Concept:** switch-case, input handling, basic arithmetic

---

### Homework 5: Complex condition logic (Advanced)  
**Problem:** Write an if-else block to check if a character entered is a vowel (case-insensitive). Use logical operators to combine conditions and print `"Vowel"` or `"Not a vowel"`.  
**Key Concept:** Multiple condition checks with logical OR (`||`)

# Additional Notes for Teachers

- Encourage live coding and interactive examples during teaching.  
- Use visuals/flowcharts to explain decision paths.  
- Reinforce the importance of readability and avoiding deep nesting.  
- Suggest students test edge cases for their decision logic blocks.  
- Highlight how decision making improves user experience in applications.
