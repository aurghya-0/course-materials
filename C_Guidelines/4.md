## 1. Teaching Outline

### Introduction
- Brief overview of why these fundamental concepts are important.
- Explain that these are core programming skills useful in problem-solving.

---

### Part 1: Exchanging Values of Two Variables

**Key Definitions:**
- Variable: A storage location identified by a memory address and a variable name.
- Swapping: Interchanging the values stored in two variables.

**Important Syntax and Rules:**

- Using a temporary variable for swap  
```c
int a = 5, b = 10, temp;
temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
```

- Without temporary variable (using arithmetic):  
```c
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
```

- Without temporary variable (using XOR):  
```c
a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;
```

**Examples and Demonstrations:**
- Live code swapping two integers.
- Highlight pros and cons of each method.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Forgetting the temporary variable, causing loss of data.
- Using arithmetic swap leading to overflow risks if numbers are large.
- Misusing XOR swap without understanding bitwise operations.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Algorithms requiring rearrangement, sorting elements.
- Games or UI requiring position swaps.

### Part 2: Summation of a Set of Numbers

**Key Definitions:**
- Summation: The addition of a sequence of numbers.
- Loop: A control structure that repeats a block of code.

**Important Syntax and Rules:**
- Using `for` loop to iterate through numbers.
- Using an accumulator variable to keep sum.

```c
int sum = 0;
for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
    sum += i; // or sum += arr[i]; if summing array values
}
```

**Examples and Demonstrations:**
- Summing numbers from 1 to 10.
- Sum of an array elements provided by the user.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not initializing the sum variable to zero.
- Off-by-one errors in loops.
- Incorrect indexing in arrays.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Calculating totals like payroll, scores, or inventory.

---

### Part 3: Reversing Digits of an Integer

**Key Definitions:**
- Integer reversal: Changing the order of digits in a number from end to start.
- Modulus `%` operator: Gives remainder.
- Integer division `/`: Divides and drops the remainder.

**Important Syntax and Rules:**
- Extract last digit using `% 10`.
- Build reversed number by multiplying existing reversed number by 10 and adding the last digit.
- Remove last digit by dividing integer by 10.

```c
int reversed = 0;
while(num != 0) {
    int digit = num % 10;
    reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;
    num = num / 10;
}
```

**Examples and Demonstrations:**
- Reverse `12345` → `54321`.
- What happens when number is negative or zero?

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Forgetting integer division.
- Not correctly handling zero or negative numbers.
- Using incorrect data types causing overflow.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Palindrome checks.
- Numerical problem-solving in math or cryptography.

---

### Question 5: Reverse a Given Integer Number  
- **Concept Tested:** Modulus and division operations  
- **Problem:** Write a program that takes an integer input and prints the reversed number.

## Additional Tips for Teaching:

- Emphasize code tracing: walk through example inputs step-by-step.
- Use visualization tools or colored pens to show swaps and digit extraction.
- Encourage students to test boundary cases: zero, negative numbers, large values.
- Reinforce coding style: use meaningful variable names and comments.
- Engage students with "what if" questions such as "What happens if one variable is zero?" or "What if the integer is negative?"
