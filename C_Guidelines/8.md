# Teaching Guideline: Find Square Root of a Quadratic Equation (C Programming)

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### A. Introduction to Quadratic Equations
- **Key definitions:**
  - Quadratic equation format: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)
  - Coefficients: \( a, b, c \)
  - Roots/solutions: solutions \(x\) satisfying equation
  - Discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac\)
- **Importance of discriminant:**
  - \(D > 0\): Two distinct real roots
  - \(D = 0\): One real root (repeated)
  - \(D < 0\): Complex roots (non-real)

### B. Square Root and Discriminant in Solving Quadratics
- Using the quadratic formula: 
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]
- Role of the square root function (`sqrt`) for discriminant calculation
- Handling different cases based on discriminant

### C. Important C Syntax & Rules
- Including math library: `#include <math.h>`
- Using `sqrt(double)` function from math library
- Data types: `double` or `float` for roots (precision)
- Validating input to avoid division by zero (e.g., \(a \neq 0\))
- Conditional statements for discriminant checks
- Printing formatted output with `printf` and format specifiers (e.g. `%lf` for double)
- Linking math library during compilation (`-lm` flag)

### D. Step-by-Step Example Demonstration
- Show example: \(2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0\)
- Calculate discriminant in C
- Calculate roots using sqrt
- Print roots
- Show behavior for different discriminant values

### E. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting `#include <math.h>`
- Not adding `-lm` flag during compilation (`gcc program.c -o program -lm`)
- Using `int` instead of `double` for roots (less precise)
- Not checking if \(a=0\) (then not a quadratic equation)
- Trying to sqrt a negative discriminant without handling complex roots
- Poor input validation
- Printing without formatting specifiers or wrong specifiers

### F. Real-world Applications
- Physics (projectile motion: time to hit ground)
- Engineering (circuit analysis, mechanical systems)
- Computer graphics (parabolas for trajectories)
- Financial modeling (polynomial fitting, curve approximation)
