# Teaching Guideline: Simple C Programs of the Given Algorithms

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### Introduction
- **What is an algorithm?**  
  Step-by-step procedure to solve a problem logically.
- **Why use algorithms in C programming?**  
  Algorithms help design efficient and correct programs.

---

### Key Definitions
- **Algorithm:** Sequence of instructions to solve a problem.
- **Flowchart:** Visual representation of an algorithm.
- **Pseudocode:** Plain language representation of algorithms.
- **Syntax:** Set of rules for writing valid C programs.
- **Data Types:** int, float, char, etc., used in variables.
- **Control Structures:** if-else, loops (for, while, do-while).

---

### Important Syntax and Rules in C
- Program structure: `#include` directives, `main()` function, braces `{}`, semicolons `;`.
- Variable declaration and initialization.
- Basic input-output: `printf()`, `scanf()`.
- Operators: arithmetic, relational, logical.
- Control statements syntax.
- Function usage (brief intro if time permits).

---

### Core Algorithms to Cover (with C program demonstrations)
- **Finding the Largest of Three Numbers**
- **Checking Even or Odd Number**
- **Calculating Factorial of a Number**
- **Sum of Natural Numbers using Loop**
- **Simple Fibonacci Series Generation**

---

### Examples and Demonstrations
For each algorithm:
- Explain the problem it solves.
- Write stepwise algorithm/pseudocode.
- Translate to C code highlighting syntax.
- Compile and run to see output.
- Modify code interactively (e.g., change input values).

Example:
- Largest of Three Numbers:  
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    printf("Enter three numbers: ");
    scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
    if (a >= b && a >= c)
        printf("Largest is %d\n", a);
    else if (b >= a && b >= c)
        printf("Largest is %d\n", b);
    else
        printf("Largest is %d\n", c);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting semicolons.
- Using wrong format specifiers in `scanf()`/`printf()`.
- Mixing up `=` (assignment) and `==` (comparison).
- Incorrect use of logical operators.
- Not initializing variables before use.
- Infinite loops due to wrong loop conditions.

---

### Real-World Applications
- Fundamental programming skills needed for software development.
- Problem-solving in embedded systems, game development, and automation.
- Foundation for learning data structures and algorithms.

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

1. **Problem:** Write a C program that takes one integer input and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.  
   **Concept Tested:** if-else structure, relational operators.  
   **Hint:** Use `if`, `else if` and `else` statements.

2. **Problem:** Write a C program to print the first 10 even numbers using a for loop.  
   **Concept Tested:** for loop and arithmetic operators.  
   **Hint:** Even numbers can be checked using `%` (modulus).

3. **Problem:** Implement a program to find the factorial of a number using a while loop.  
   **Concept Tested:** loops, multiplication, variables initialization.  
   **Hint:** Factorial of n = n * (n-1) * ... * 1.

4. **Problem:** Write a program that checks if a number is a palindrome (reads same forwards and backwards) assuming input is a 3-digit number.  
   **Concept Tested:** integer operations and control statements.  
   **Hint:** Extract digits using `% 10` and `/ 10`.

5. **Problem:** Write a program to generate the first N Fibonacci numbers, where N is user input.  
   **Concept Tested:** loops, variable swapping, sequence generation.  
   **Hint:** Fibonacci starts with 0 and 1; next = sum of previous two.
