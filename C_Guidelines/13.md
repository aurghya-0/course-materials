# Teaching Guideline: Arithmetic Operators and Expressions, Constants and Literals (C Programming)

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### A. Introduction to Arithmetic Operators and Expressions
- **Key Definitions:**
  - *Arithmetic Operators*: Symbols used to perform mathematical operations on variables and constants.
  - *Expression*: A combination of variables, constants, and operators that evaluate to a value.
- **Important Operators in C:**
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`) — remainder of division (integers only)
- **Syntax and Rules:**
  - Basic arithmetic syntax: `result = operand1 operator operand2;`
  - Operator precedence and associativity in expressions:
    - Multiplication, division and modulus have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
    - Associativity is left to right for these operators.
  - Use of parentheses `()` to override precedence.
  - Division between integers results in an integer (floor of division).
- **Examples and Demos:**
  - Simple arithmetic operations.
  - Expressing complex calculations using multiple operators and parentheses.
  - Demonstrate integer vs. floating point division.
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
  - Confusing assignment `=` with equality `==`.
  - Integer division truncating decimal parts unintentionally.
  - Using modulus operator on floating point numbers.
  - Forgetting operator precedence, causing unexpected results.
- **Real-World Applications:**
  - Basic calculators.
  - Financial calculations (simple interest etc.).
  - Algorithms involving mathematical formulas.

### B. Constants and Literals in C
- **Key Definitions:**
  - *Constant*: A fixed value that does not change during program execution.
  - *Literal*: A notation for representing fixed values directly in source code.
- **Types of Constants and Literals:**
  - Integer literals (`100`, `-50`)
  - Floating-point literals (`3.14`, `-0.001`)
  - Character literals (`'a'`, `'Z'`)
  - String literals (`"Hello"`)
  - Boolean literals (in stdbool.h: `true`, `false`)
- **Syntax and Rules for Constants and Literals:**
  - Integer literals: can be decimal, octal (starts with 0), or hexadecimal (starts with 0x).
  - Floating-point literals: can use decimal notation or scientific notation.
  - Character literals use single quotes.
  - String literals use double quotes and are arrays of characters.
  - Constants can be created using `#define` or `const` keyword.
- **Examples and Demonstrations:**
  - Declaring constants using `const int DAYS = 7;`
  - Defining constants with `#define PI 3.14159`
  - Using different literal types in expressions.
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
  - Forgetting to add a semicolon after constant declarations.
  - Trying to change a constant’s value.
  - Misunderstanding escape sequences in character literals.
  - Using uninitialized constants.
- **Real-World Applications:**
  - Defining fixed values such as the number of days in a week or tax rates.
  - Using constants improves code readability and maintainability.

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

### Question 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
- **Problem:** Write a C program to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two integers entered by the user.
- **Concept Tested:** Basic arithmetic operators and integer division.
- **Hint:** Remember that integer division truncates decimal parts.

### Question 2: Understanding Modulus Operator
- **Problem:** Write a program that checks if a number entered by the user is even or odd using the modulus operator.
- **Concept Tested:** Modulus operator (%) usage.
- **Hint:** Even numbers have remainder 0 when divided by 2.

### Question 3: Operator Precedence
- **Problem:** What is the output of the expression `3 + 4 * 5 / 2 - 1` in C? Explain why.
- **Concept Tested:** Operator precedence and associativity.
- **Hint:** Compute multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

### Question 4: Using Constants in Expressions
- **Problem:** Define a constant `PI` with value 3.14 using `const` keyword. Use it to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.
- **Concept Tested:** Using constants and floating-point arithmetic.
- **Hint:** Area = PI * radius * radius.

### Question 5: Combining Literals and Variables
- **Problem:** Write a program to calculate and print the total price after adding a fixed tax rate (e.g., 5%) to a product price given by the user. Use a defined constant for the tax rate.
- **Concept Tested:** Constants, literals, arithmetic expressions.
- **Hint:** Total price = price + (price * tax_rate).

## 3. Homework Practice Questions

### Question 1: Calculate Simple Interest
- **Problem:** Write a program that calculates simple interest using the formula: `SI = (P * R * T) / 100` where `P` is principal, `R` is rate of interest, and `T` is time in years. Define all three values as constants.
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Key Concept:** Constants and arithmetic expressions.

### Question 2: Character Literal Manipulation
- **Problem:** Write a program that inputs a character and prints its ASCII value and the next character in the alphabet.
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Concept:** Character literals and arithmetic with characters.

### Question 3: Integer vs Floating-Point Division
- **Problem:** Write a program where you divide two numbers - first as integers, then as floats - and observe the differences. Print both results.
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Concept:** Data types, division behavior, expressions.

### Question 4: Complex Expression Evaluation
- **Problem:** Without running the code, manually evaluate the following expression: `7 + 3 * (10 / (12 / (3 + 1) - 1))` Assume all are integers.
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Key Concept:** Operator precedence, nested expressions.

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Key Concept:** Using multiple constants and arithmetic expressions.
