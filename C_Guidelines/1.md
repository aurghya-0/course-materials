## 1. Teaching Outline

### Introduction
- Brief overview of computation and programming
- Why understanding models and algorithms is essential

---

### A. The Basic Model of Computation
- **Key Definitions:**
  - Computation: The process of executing well-defined steps to solve a problem.
  - Model of Computation: Abstract definition of how computations are performed (e.g., Turing Machine, finite automata, RAM model).
  - Input, Process, Output: The fundamental elements of computation.
- **Important Points:**
  - Focus on the simplified model: Input → Processing Unit → Output.
  - Explain memory, CPU, and instructions as fundamental components.
- **Examples/Demonstration:**
  - Show a simple description of a computation like addition.
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Confusing input and output.
  - Not recognizing that computation requires a sequence of steps.
- **Real-world Applications:**
  - All software processes follow this basic model underneath, from calculators to complex apps.

### B. Algorithms
- **Key Definitions:**
  - Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.
  - Properties: Finiteness, Definiteness, Input, Output, Effectiveness.
- **Important Points / Rules:**
  - Steps should be clear, unambiguous, and ordered.
  - An algorithm must terminate after finite steps.
- **Examples/Demonstration:**
  - Algorithm for finding the maximum of three numbers.
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Writing steps that are ambiguous.
  - Missing termination criteria.
- **Real-world Applications:**
  - Sorting data, searching in databases, solving puzzles or math problems.

### C. Flow-Charts
- **Key Definitions:**
  - Flowchart: A diagram representing an algorithm using symbols.
- **Important Symbols:**
  - Oval: Start/End
  - Parallelogram: Input/Output
  - Rectangle: Process
  - Diamond: Decision/Condition
  - Arrows: Flow of control
- **Rules for Creating Flowcharts:**
  - Start with the Start symbol.
  - Use arrows to connect steps logically.
  - Use decision symbols for branching.
- **Examples/Demonstration:**
  - Flowchart to find if a number is even or odd.
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Missing arrows or connections.
  - Mixing flow directions.
  - Using wrong symbols.
- **Real-world Applications:**
  - Used in software design, troubleshooting processes.

### D. Programming Fundamentals in C
- **Key Definitions:**
  - Program: Instructions to a computer written in a programming language.
  - Syntax: Rules for writing valid C code.
- **Important Syntax & Rules:**
  - Basic structure of a C program (`#include`, `main()`, variables, statements).
  - Data types, variables, operators, control structures (`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`).
  - Input/output functions: `printf()`, `scanf()`.
- **Examples/Demonstration:**
  - Write a simple C program to read two numbers and print their sum.
- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Forgetting semicolons.
  - Mismatched braces.
  - Incorrect format specifiers in `scanf`/`printf`.
- **Real-world Applications:**
  - Writing software, automation scripts, embedded systems.

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

| No. | Problem Statement                                      | Concept Tested                        | Hints (optional)                                   |
|------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|1|Write the algorithm (in pseudocode) to find the largest of two numbers.| Algorithm design and clarity | Think about the steps: input, compare, output result.|
|2|Draw a flowchart for the algorithm to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.| Flowchart construction and symbol use | Use decision diamonds for checking conditions.    |
|3|Write a C program that takes an integer input and prints whether it is odd or even.| Programming syntax, control structures | Use `%2` operator, `if-else`.                      |
|4|Explain what happens if you forget to include a `return 0;` statement at the end of `main()` in a C program.| Understanding program execution & conventions | Does C standard require explicit return for `main()`? Are there compiler warnings?|
|5|Given the algorithm below, identify and correct the mistake: "Start → Input number → If number > 10 then print ‘Big’ →" (No termination step)| Algorithm completeness and termination | Every algorithm must end; missing output or stop step.|

# Additional Notes for Instructor

- Use live demonstrations to write simple C programs — project on screen or IDE based.
- Frequently pause for questions — clarify confusion on concepts like flowchart symbols or algorithm steps.
- Leverage class participation for flowchart drawing — draw diagrams on board or tablet.
- Use analogies when explaining computation (e.g., cooking recipe as algorithm).
- Emphasize the flow of logic in both algorithms and programming — concept of sequence, decision, and repetition.
- Remind students that writing correct algorithms simplifies coding and debugging.
- Introduce common programming errors early to build habits for avoiding them.
