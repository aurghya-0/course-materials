## Teaching Guideline: Break, Continue, and Switch Statements in C

---

### 1. Teaching Outline

#### Introduction
- Brief recap of loops and conditionals (for context).

#### Key Definitions
- **Break**: A statement used to immediately exit the current loop or switch case.
- **Continue**: A statement that skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves control to the next iteration.
- **Switch**: A control statement that allows multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.

#### Section 1: Break Statement
- **Purpose**: To terminate a loop or switch statement prematurely.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  break;
  ```
- **Where to use**:
  - Inside loops (for, while, do-while).
  - Inside switch cases.
- **Example**:
  - Breaking out of a `for` loop when a condition is met.
- **Common mistakes**:
  - Using break outside loops or switch (causes compilation error).
  - Overusing break inside loops makes the code less readable.

#### Section 2: Continue Statement
- **Purpose**: To skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  continue;
  ```
- **Where to use**:
  - Inside loops only.
- **Example**:
  - Skipping even numbers inside a loop that prints odd numbers.
- **Common mistakes**:
  - Using continue outside loops.
  - Confusing continue with break (continue only skips iteration, break exits loop).

#### Section 3: Switch Statement
- **Purpose**: To replace multiple `if-else if` with a cleaner multi-branch decision.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  switch(expression) {
      case constant1:
          // code
          break;
      case constant2:
          // code
          break;
      default:
          // code if no case matches
  }
  ```
- **Important rules**:
  - Expression must be an integer, char, or enum.
  - Cases must be constant expressions (no variables).
  - Use `break` to prevent fall-through.
  - `default` is optional but recommended.
- **Example**:
  - Menu-driven program or choosing a day of the week.
- **Common mistakes**:
  - Forgetting break causes fall-through (executing multiple cases).
  - Using non-constant in case labels.
  - Using switch with inappropriate data types (like float or string).

#### Section 4: Combined Usage and Best Practices
- When to use break and continue to improve code clarity.
- Avoid deep nesting that requires many breaks.
- Carefully manage fall-through in switch statements for clean logic.
  
#### Section 5: Real-World Applications
- Break and continue: Input validation loops, searching algorithms, filtering data streams.
- Switch: Command interpreters, menu selection, parsing enumerated types.

### 2. In-Class Practice Questions

---

**Question 1: Basic Break in Loop**  
*Problem:* Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but stops printing if the number is greater than 5.  
*Concepts tested:* Basic loop and break usage.  
*Hint:* Use an if condition inside the loop to check the number and break.

---

**Question 2: Using Continue to Skip Iterations**  
*Problem:* Write a `for` loop to print all numbers between 1 and 10 except multiples of 3.  
*Concepts tested:* Using continue to skip iterations.  
*Hint:* Use modulo operator `%` to find multiples of 3.

---

**Question 3: Switch Case with Days of the Week**  
*Problem:* Write a switch statement that takes an integer (1-7) and prints the corresponding day of the week (1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, â€¦). Print "Invalid day" for any other number.  
*Concepts tested:* Switch syntax, cases, default case.  
*Hint:* Use `break` after each case to avoid fall-through.

---

**Question 4: Nested Loops with Break and Continue**  
*Problem:* Nested loops where the outer loop runs 1 to 3 and the inner loop runs 1 to 5. Print both indices but skip printing if the inner loop index is 3. Stop the inner loop completely if the outer loop index equals the inner loop index.  
*Concepts tested:* Nested loop control and combined use of continue and break.  
*Hint:* Carefully place break and continue statements inside inner loop.

---

**Question 5: Fall-through in Switch Case**  
*Problem:* Write a switch statement on a character grade 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'F'. Print specific messages for each grade. Let 'A' and 'B' fall-through to print "Excellent" and 'C' and 'D' print "Pass". Use fall-through intentionally and a default.  
*Concepts tested:* Understanding fall-through, intentional omission of break.  
*Hint:* Use comments to mark intentional fall-through.

### 3. Homework Practice Questions

---

**Question 1: Loop with Break and Input Validation**  
*Problem:* Write a `while` loop to take input numbers from the user until they enter a negative number. Use break to exit the loop if the number is negative. Print the count of valid inputs entered.  
*Difficulty:* Easy  
*Concept:* Loop control and break with user input.

---

**Question 2: Filtering Even Numbers Using Continue**  
*Problem:* Write a program that prints odd numbers from 1 to 50 using a loop and the continue statement.  
*Difficulty:* Easy  
*Concept:* Continue to skip even numbers.

---

**Question 3: Menu-Driven Calculator Using Switch**  
*Problem:* Write a simple menu-driven calculator that asks the user to input two numbers and a choice of operation (+, -, *, /). Use a switch on the choice character and perform the operation. Use default to handle invalid choices.  
*Difficulty:* Medium  
*Concept:* Switch case with characters and arithmetic operations.

---

**Question 4: Identifying Prime Numbers Using Break**  
*Problem:* Write a program to check if a number is prime by using a loop. Use break to exit the loop early if a factor is found.  
*Difficulty:* Medium  
*Concept:* Using break for efficient loops.

---

**Question 5: Complex Switch and Loop Interaction**  
*Problem:* Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a character command:  
- 'a' to print "Add",  
- 'd' to print "Delete",  
- 'u' to print "Update",  
- 'q' to quit the program.  
Use a switch statement inside a loop. Use break correctly to exit and continue to skip invalid commands with a message.  
*Difficulty:* Medium-Advanced  
*Concept:* Loop, switch, break, and continue combined.
