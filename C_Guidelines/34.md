# Teaching Guideline for Bootcamp Session: Passing Arguments to a Function in C  
## Topic: Call by Value vs Call by Reference  

---

## 1. Teaching Outline  

### A. Introduction to Function Arguments  
- **Definition:** Explain what it means to pass arguments to functions. Arguments are values or variables you give to a function so it can use them during execution.  
- Importance of understanding how arguments are passed to functions.

### B. Call by Value  
- **Definition:** The function receives a copy of the actual argument’s value. Changes in the function do not affect the original variable.  
- **Syntax and Rules:** Show basic function prototype and call where arguments are passed by value.  
  - Example: `void increment(int x);`  
- **Demonstration:**  
  - Write a simple function that tries to modify an integer argument.  
  - Show that the original variable remains unchanged after the function call.  
- **Memory behavior:** Explain that a copy is made in a different memory location.

### C. Call by Reference  
- **Definition:** The function receives the address of the argument, allowing it to modify the original variable.  
- **How it is done in C:** Use pointers to achieve call by reference.  
- **Syntax and Rules:**  
  - Function prototype with pointer parameter, e.g., `void increment(int *x);`  
  - Calling function with the address operator `&`.  
- **Demonstration:**  
  - Write a function to increment an integer via pointer.  
  - Show that the value of the original variable changes after the function call.  
- **Memory behavior:** Discuss how original memory is accessed via pointers.

### D. Comparison: Call by Value vs Call by Reference  
- Side-by-side example highlighting the difference in output and effect on original variables.  
- Discuss use-cases where one is preferred over the other.

### E. Common Mistakes to Avoid  
- Forgetting to use the address-of operator `&` when passing a variable to a pointer argument.  
- Dereferencing pointers incorrectly inside function.  
- Trying to modify a variable passed by value expecting the original to change.  
- Passing uninitialized pointers or incorrect types.

### F. Real-world Applications  
- Modifying multiple values in a function without using global variables.  
- Improving memory and time efficiency by avoiding copying large structures.  
- Implementing data structures (like linked lists) that require pointer manipulation.

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions  

### Question 1:  
**Problem:** Write a function that attempts to set an integer variable to zero using call by value. Call it with a variable initialized to 10 and print the variable before and after the function call.  
**Concept Tested:** Understanding call by value behavior.  
**Hint:** Changes inside the function won't affect the original variable.

---

### Question 2:  
**Problem:** Modify the previous function to use call by reference so that the integer variable is actually changed after the function call.  
**Concept Tested:** Usage of pointers to modify original variables.  
**Hint:** Pass the address of the variable and dereference the pointer inside the function.

---

### Question 3:  
**Problem:** Given a function that takes two integers and swaps their values, implement it using call by reference, so the swap affects the originals.  
**Concept Tested:** Practical use of call by reference for swapping values.  
**Hint:** Use pointers for both arguments.

---

### Question 4:  
**Problem:** Why won’t the swapping function work correctly if you pass the integers by value? Explain and demonstrate with code.  
**Concept Tested:** Clear understanding of call by value limitations.  
**Hint:** Trace the variable values inside and outside the function.

---

### Question 5:  
**Problem:** Write a function `void updateArray(int arr[], int size)` that multiplies each element by 2. Is this call by value or call by reference? Explain why.  
**Concept Tested:** Arrays and pointers; concept of call by reference with arrays.  
**Hint:** Arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions.

---

## 3. Homework Practice Questions  

### Question 1:  
**Problem:** Write a program that uses a call by reference function to find the minimum and maximum of two numbers passed as pointers.  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Concept Tested:** Working with pointers and multiple outputs via call by reference.

---

### Question 2:  
**Problem:** Explain in your own words the difference between call by value and call by reference. Provide two real-world scenarios where each might be preferred.  
**Difficulty:** Conceptual, medium  
**Concept Tested:** Concept reinforcement and application thinking.

---

### Question 3:  
**Problem:** Implement a function `void incrementAll(int *arr, int size)` that increments each element of the array by 1. Show how you would call this function from `main`.  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Concept Tested:** Pointer syntax and call by reference with arrays.

---

### Question 4:  
**Problem:** Consider the following code snippet. Does it print the modified values of `a` and `b` correctly? Why or why not? Fix the code if needed.  
```c
void changeValues(int a, int b) {
    a = 100;
    b = 200;
}
int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    changeValues(a, b);
    printf("%d %d\n", a, b);
    return 0;
}
```  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Concept Tested:** Call by value vs call by reference understanding.

---

### Question 5:  
**Problem:** Write a function that swaps two strings using call by reference. Hint: Use double pointers or pointers to pointers.  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Concept Tested:** Pointer manipulation, understanding references with complex data types.

# Instruction Notes for Teacher  
- Begin with simple, relatable examples and gradually increase complexity.  
- Use diagrams and memory maps to illustrate how values and pointers differ in memory.  
- Encourage students to write and test code live; this topic benefits greatly from hands-on practice.  
- Use pair programming or group discussions on tricky pointers concepts to reinforce learning.  
- Quickly address common syntax errors to avoid student frustration.  
- When assigning homework, encourage students to explain their code in their own words to internalize concepts.
