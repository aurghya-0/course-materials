# Teaching Guideline: Array Manipulation - Searching (C Programming)

---

## 1. Teaching Outline

### A. Introduction to Array Searching

- **Definition of Searching**:  
  Finding the presence or position of a specific element within a collection (array).  
- **Purpose**: Efficient data retrieval from arrays.

### B. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Array**: A collection of elements, accessed by indices, stored contiguously in memory.  
- **Searching Algorithms**:  
  - *Linear Search*: Checks each element sequentially.  
  - *Binary Search*: Efficient search on sorted arrays, repeatedly divides the array in half.  
- **Index**: Position of an element in an array.  
- **Sorted Array**: Array elements arranged in ascending/descending order (required for Binary Search).

### C. Important Syntax and Rules (in C)

- **Array Declaration**:  
  ```c
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  ```
- **Access Element**:  
  ```c
  int x = arr[2];  // Access third element (index starts at 0)
  ```
- **Linear Search Function Prototype**:  
  ```c
  int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int key);
  ```
- **Binary Search Function Prototype**:  
  ```c
  int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int key);
  ```
- **Loop Constructs** (for traversal): `for`, `while`

### D. Linear Search

- **Algorithm Steps**:  
  1. Start at the first element.  
  2. Compare element with the key.  
  3. If match, return index.  
  4. Move to next element if no match.  
  5. If end reached, return -1 (not found).  

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)

- **Example**:  
  ```c
  int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int key) {
      for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
          if (arr[i] == key) return i;
      }
      return -1;
  }
  ```

### E. Binary Search

- **Prerequisite**: Array must be sorted.  
- **Algorithm Steps**:  
  1. Initialize start and end indices.  
  2. Find middle index: `mid = (start + end) / 2`.  
  3. Compare middle element with key.  
  4. If equal, return mid.  
  5. If key < arr[mid], search left half.  
  6. Else search right half.  
  7. Repeat until found or subarray empty.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)

- **Example**:  
  ```c
  int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int key) {
      int start = 0, end = size - 1;

      while (start <= end) {
          int mid = (start + end) / 2;

          if (arr[mid] == key) return mid;
          else if (key < arr[mid]) end = mid - 1;
          else start = mid + 1;
      }
      return -1;
  }
  ```

### F. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Linear Search**:  
  - Forgetting to check all elements.  
  - Returning incorrect index or not handling the “not found” case (-1).  

- **Binary Search**:  
  - Using binary search on unsorted data.  
  - Incorrect calculation of `mid` leading to infinite loops.  
  - Off-by-one errors in updating `start` and `end`.  
  - Integer overflow when computing `mid` (use `mid = start + (end - start)/2` to prevent).  

- **General**:  
  - Confusing array indices (0-based).  
  - Not checking array boundaries during traversal.

### G. Real-World Applications

- Searching for a username or password in user databases (linear if unsorted, binary if sorted).  
- Looking up items in product lists, menus, or catalogs.  
- Algorithms in databases and text processing often rely on searching.

## 2. In-Class Practice Questions

### Question 1: Find Element with Linear Search  
**Problem:** Given an array `int arr[5] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}`, write a function to find the index of element `6`.  
**Concept Tested:** Linear search basics.  
**Hint:** Check each element in order.

---

### Question 2: Handle Element Not Found Case  
**Problem:** Modify the linear search function to return `-1` if the element is not present. Test it with key = `7` on the above array.  
**Concept Tested:** Proper handling of “not found” scenario.

---

### Question 3: Binary Search Implementation  
**Problem:** Write a function that performs binary search on a sorted array `int arr[6] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}` to find element `7`.  
**Concept Tested:** Binary search logic; searching sorted array.  
**Hint:** Implement while loop with start, end, mid.

---

### Question 4: Binary Search on Unsorted Array  
**Problem:** What happens if you apply binary search on array `int arr[5] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3}` for key `4`? Explain.  
**Concept Tested:** Importance of sorting for binary search; conceptual understanding.

### Question 5: Debugging Binary Search  
**Problem:** Review this binary search code snippet, identify and fix errors:  
```c
int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int key) {
    int start = 0, end = size;
    while (start < end) {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == key) return mid;
        else if (key < arr[mid]) end = mid;
        else start = mid + 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

- Use visual aids for binary search (e.g., showing array halves visually).  
- Discuss efficiency benefits to motivate learning binary search over linear search for sorted data.
